Please read the following article: [The ultimate Webpack setup](http://www.christianalfoni.com/articles/2015_04_19_The-ultimate-webpack-setup) 
This repo is mostly copy of that. I'am leaving webpack so I wanted to save my knowledge for later =)

#About
- Personal template!
- I am not a js guy yet, just needed to edit some jquery and wanted to dive into it, but naeeeh.
- So I'am going back to the gulp!

#### What I learned is that **gulp** is better for **css** endpoint and **webpack** is more for **js**,  see more here:

- [Problem with Hot reload & css - separate inline endpoint](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/30#issuecomment-220724110) I did not manage to get it working :(
