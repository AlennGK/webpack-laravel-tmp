#Webpack 2 is here!
Solved css-sass hot reload make me move from gulp to webpack! Finally.

#About
- Template for my project and simple example for you.
- Replacement for gulp fast and furious enviroment to code css-sass and later js and maybe vue or react.
- It is more simple and faster solution. I love the webpack server wich allow me to edit my sass system and see the outcome instantly, with gulp it was realy hard to set all pipes even for css not mentioning js, but if you want to use gulp look bellow.
- Next step for me will be laravel aplication with laravel MIX wich using webpack too.
